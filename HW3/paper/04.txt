 Tension and velocity control of a belt on    Two electric drives coupled with a flexible belt that passes through a pulley with a system that allows measuring its
 a two coupled electric drives system         velocity and tension. The main control problem is to change the torque in the motors in order to regulate the tension
                                              and the velocity of the belt. This can be done either individually or simultaneously.
 Level control in a four tanks system         At the bottom of each tank, there is an outlet of known section and another one with an unknown section, regulated
                                              by means of a valve that enables or disables the corresponding perturbation. The system also has two three-way valves
                                              that allow regulating the flow, coming from two pumps, that enters in each of the tanks.

                                              servomotor and can rotate about its axis. The rotation of the hoop causes an oscillatory movement of the ball around
                                              its equilibrium point. The behavior of the ball is similar to the dynamic of a liquid inside a cylindrical container,
                                              being the main objective to control these oscillations.
 Control of the ball and plate system         This system consists of a ball rolling on a rigid square plate. The main purpose of this system is to control the position
                                              of the ball by manipulating the slope of the plate in two perpendicular directions. This system is employed in the
