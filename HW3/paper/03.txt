   In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method, the train 
operation data is used from the reference (Lei, 2017). The experiment         The  parameters  of the established optimization model  are given: 
data includes the arrival time and departure time of trains from Tianshui  TIa  a = TId  d = TIa  d = 3, TOPi,j are equal to the duration in the

direct or express, express, ordinary, freight and luggage. The experiment  corresponding two stations in the original train schedule. The parame­
data of some trains in the data is shown Table 4. The diagonal line in­    ters are shown in Table 1. 
dicates that the terminal station of the train is in front of the station. 
   To fully test the performance of QGDECC on different delay condi­
tions, two kinds of train late scheduling problems are considered in here. 5.4. Train scheduling results and analysis 
Case 1  is that some trains are late, Train K1059, Train 10605, Train 
10,407 and Train 10,613 are late 6 min, the other trains are not late.        The experiment results are shown in Table 5. 
Case 2 is that all trains on the railways are late. All trains are 13 min late From the experimental results in Table 5, it can be seen that when 
except Train K059, Train K749, Train 10,604 and Train K1309.               there are some delays in the railway network, the train delay scheduling
